# Virtual Mail

**Virtual Mail** is a web-based application developed using ASP.NET Core that allows users to send and receive emails within the platform, simulating an email client experience. The project does not use traditional email protocols like IMAP or POP3 but instead mocks the functionalities of an email service. The frontend is designed using Bootstrap CSS, and the backend leverages PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- **Inbox Management:** Users can view their received emails, including sender information, subject, and timestamp.
- **Email Composition:** Users can compose and send new emails to other registered users.
- **View and Reply to Emails:** Users can view detailed emails and reply directly from the interface. The "To" field in replies is auto-populated and read-only.
- **Sent Emails Management:** Users can view a list of sent emails and their details.
- **Email Deletion:** Emails can be deleted from the inbox.
